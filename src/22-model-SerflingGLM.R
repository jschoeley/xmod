#' @details
#' A Serfling style GLM is fitted over the training data and expected
#' death counts are predicted over the complete input data frame. The
#' training data is indicated by the column <col_sample> and can further
#' be subset by specifying <weeks_for_training> and <n_years_for_training>.
#' All models in <models> are fit separately by stratum and within
#' each stratum the model with the lowest AIC is chosen for prediction.
#' By default, the input <df> is returned with added expected death
#' counts and <nsim> columns holding simulated death counts from the
#' predicted distribution of counts.
#'
#' @return
#' <df> with added column <deaths_predicted> containing the expected
#' death counts, and columns <deaths_sim><1:nsim> containing simulated
#' expected death counts if simulate_y = FALSE or simulated deaths from
#' the predicted outcome distribution if simulate_y = TRUE.
